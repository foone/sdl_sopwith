If the "medals" game option is turned on, you may be rewarded with medals
for the following:

 * Shooting down 5 planes
 * Shooting down 25 planes (difficult!)
 * Three successful raids
 * Finishing a level with no planes lost
 * Gaining 25 points in a single flight, where 3 points are awarded per plane
   and 4 per building
 * As above, a second time
 * Returning to base after having been damaged
 * Gaining a certain amount of points for destroyed planes and buildings; the
   points depend on whether the player was damaged at that point in time, and
   how far away the destroyed object was from the player's base
 * As above, but a few more points

All medals and counters for these are reset once a plane is destroyed.
