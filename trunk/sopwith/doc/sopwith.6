.SH HISTORY
Sopwith was originally developed by BMB Compuscience of Canada as a 
demonstration game for their Imaginet Networking System. The system
failed to become popular but Sopwith became a popular game for the IBM
PC and compatibles. A sequel "Sopwith 2" was actually a newer version
rather than a different game, but included many extra features, such
as Oxen and birds. Sopwith was also ported to the Atari. The 
original author, David L. Clark, later created Sopwith - The Network
Edition with several extra features including missiles. This version of
sopwith is based on the released source code to the Network Edition.
