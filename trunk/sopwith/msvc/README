These are some files which may help building using MSVC. I managed to
get it to build under MSVC++.NET after a couple of minor alterations, 
albeit with no networking support.

If you want to try this, you will probably need to copy sopwith.vcproj
to the parent directory, and add include paths to include the SDL 
headers, and sopwith/src/ (some files in sopwith/src/sdl/ use files from
the parent directory and expect it in the include path)

I dont intend to really support MSVC. Its probably easier to just use
MinGW/Cygwin.
