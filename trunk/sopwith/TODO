to do:

Code Cleanup: 
	Remove useless files: swutil.c
	Remove old MULTIPLE game mode? (swnetio.c). Looks pretty dead.
	There are a lot of ifdefs left over to check for the
	architecture, these are redundant now and should be removed.
	Similarly there are function calls to control DOS interrupts
	which also should be removed.
DOS Port? probably wouldnt be too hard infact
Custom levels
Network:
	Infinite lives?   -- kind of annoying once you die 5 times, thats it
	Keep sending even when we are waiting for data (up to a point of 
	course). Currently the network code wont send the next movement
	until its received the next movement from the other player. As
	a result any kind of lag will drastically kill the game speed.	
	Network disconnect should bring you back to the title screen
	> 2 Players, Teams
	Extra game modes -- Capture the flag etc
Bug: If you crash into the last building in a level, the level exit sequence
runs with you inside the building rubble (!)
