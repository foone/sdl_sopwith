To Do
-----

Code Cleanup: 
	Remove useless files: swutil.c
	Restructure game to be state based - avoids all the horrible crap
		with longjmp at the moment
Network:
	Ability to abort server
	Network disconnect should bring you back to the title screen
		Also on failure to connect
	> 2 Players, Teams
	Extra game modes -- Capture the flag etc
Finish GNOME port
	Add GConf support
	Fix starting network games from the menus

Bug: If you crash into the last building in a level, the level exit sequence
	runs with you inside the building rubble (!)
